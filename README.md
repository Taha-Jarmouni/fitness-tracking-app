# fitness tracking app

The app allows users to track their workouts by recording their location, distance, duration, and
type of activity (running or cycling).

The app uses the Leaflet library to display a map and allows users to add markers to the map to
indicate the location of their workouts. Users can also view their workout history and statistics,
such as total distance and time spent exercising.

Mapty also includes a feature that allows users to save their workout data to local storage, so they
can access it even if they close the app or refresh the page. Additionally, the app includes a
feature that allows users to upload their workout data to a server, so they can access it from
multiple devices.
